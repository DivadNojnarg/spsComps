The {[systemPipeShiny](https://github.com/systemPipeR/systemPipeShiny)} (SPS) framework comes with many UI and server 
components. However, installing the whole framework is heavy and takes some time. If you 
would like to use UI and server components in your own Shiny apps, but do not want to 
install the whole framework, just install {spsComps}. 

## Install

Install release version from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("spsComps")
```

Develop version:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("spsComps", quietly=TRUE))
    remotes::install_github("lz100/spsComps")
```
